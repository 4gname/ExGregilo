# ExGregilo

The mod will potentially add GregTech support for Ex Nihlo so I can finally Skyblock with GregTech.  Theoretically I will try and make it not too slow.  As far as I know the GT API is very complicated, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to add its ores and dusts to Ex Nihlo.  If it's not possible we may need to resort to using [AOBD2](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293528-aobd-2-process-all-the-ores).

I'm going to tarket 1.7.10 support with GT5U.

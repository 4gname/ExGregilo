# ExGregilo

The mod will potentially add GregTech support for Ex Nihilo so I can finally Skyblock with GregTech.  Theoretically I will try and make it not too slow.  ~~As far as I know the GT API is very complicated, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to add its ores and dusts to Ex Nihilo.  If it's not possible we may need to resort to using [AOBD2](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293528-aobd-2-process-all-the-ores).~~ I figured out how to get the GregTech dusts from the OreDict and added to the sieve registry! Progress is progress.


I'm going to target 1.7.10 support with GT5U.
